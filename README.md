# Basic Use of Flow

## Introduction
Flow is a static type checker for javascript code using static type annotations.

* *Package Manager - `Yarn`
* *Compiler* - `Babel-cli`

## Setup Compiler

Babel is a compiler for JavaScript code that has support for Flow. Babel will take your Flow code and strip out any type annotations.

1. First install babel-cli and babel-preset-flow with either Yarn or npm, I am using yarn.
	> yarn add --dev babel-cli babel-preset-flow

2. Create a `.babelrc` file at the root of your folder with "flow" in your "presets".
	```
	{
	  "presets": ["flow"]
	}
	```
	> Presets are collections of plugins used to support particular language features.

## Compile the code using babel

If your all source of code is in `src` directory and you wish to compile them into another directore `build`
> yarn run babel src/ -d build/

Or you can add this to your `package.json` script.
	```
	{
	  "name": "flow-basic",
	  "scripts": {
	  	"build": "yarn run babel src/ -- -d build/"
	  }
	}
	```

> Note: Youâ€™ll probably want to add a `prepublish` script that runs this transform as well, so that it runs before you publish your code.

## Setup Flow

1. Add a devDependency on the flow-bin
> yarn add --dev flow-bin
2. Init the flow
> yarn run flow init

This creates an empty file `.flowconfig`, tells the Flow background process the root of where to begin checking Flow code for errors.
3. Run FLow
> yarn run flow

## Prepare your code for Flow
1. Adding flag `// flow` in your javascript file.
2. Run `flow` or `flow status`. This strats the background process which monitors all Flow files.
3. Write the flow code
	```
	// @flow
	function foo(x: ?number): string {
		if (x) {
			return x;
		}
		return "Default string";
	}
	```
